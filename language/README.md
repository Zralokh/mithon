# The Mithon Programming Language

Mithon aims to abstract from mcfunction and make it available in two abstraction levels:
- mcc: low-level abstraction, necessary data structures and common routines, command wrapping, etc.
- mithon: high-level abstraction, 'object oriented programming', custom functions, easy to use
